Lab 2: RunTime -Experimental-

Disclaimer: I know this math may feel like it belongs in a
math course, but be patient, weâ€™ll get to more fun stuff 
soon.

Step 1 (only step). 
The class Stewart has been placed in the lab 2 directory. This class contains three methods each of which takes an input N. They are named method1(..), method2(..) and method3(..).
Your job is to determine the runtime of each method as a function of N.

You should write a tester class to collect some data. Use a graping tool like Excel to present some relevant graphs.

Include in the comment section of your tester class an explanation as to why you have made your conclusion (include data as necessary).
